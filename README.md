# Features #

Image Processing: Preprocess X-ray images for enhanced analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Implement models for classification, segmentation, or anomaly detection in X-ray images.
Data Visualization: Generate visual reports and insights from X-ray data.
Extensible Framework: Easily integrate with other tools and datasets.
Cross-Platform: Compatible with multiple environments (Windows, Linux, macOS).

# Installation #

Clone the Repository:
gh repo clone abbasiibad/x_Ray_Lytics-main
cd x_Ray_Lytics


Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download Pre-trained Models or Datasets (if applicable):

Place datasets in the data/ folder.
Download pre-trained models and place them in the models/ folder.



# Usage #

Prepare Your Data:

Place X-ray images or datasets in the data/ directory.
Ensure images are in a supported format (e.g., PNG, JPEG, DICOM).


Run the Analysis:
python main.py --input data/sample_xray.png --output results/


Use --help for additional command-line options:python main.py --help




# Visualize Results: #

Results are saved in the results/ directory.
Use the provided visualization scripts to generate plots:python visualize.py --result results/output.json
